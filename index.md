Who are we?  We are a research group at Oklahoma State University that
specialize in the area of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI),
computer architecture/arithmetic, memory architectures, and Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) design flows.

[Skywater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com) has started a process
thanks to partners [Efabless](http://www.efabless.com) and
[Google](http://www.google.com) to revolutionize how we make
semiconductors.  The process here is an attempt to provide a simple way to make a
semiconductors using open-source tools.  In other words, we are
democratizing hardware design
through open-source chip design tools and methodology.

For this process we have created several tools that help with this
process.  We welcome your feedback as well as any comments to help
with this process.
