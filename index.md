description: Minimal tutorial on making a simple website with GitHub Pages
---

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).

- [Overview](pages/overview.html)
- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)

If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.
