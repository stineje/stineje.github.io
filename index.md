Who are we?  We are a research group at Oklahoma State University that
specialize in the area of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI),
computer architecture/arithmetic, memory architectures, and Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) design flows.

[Skywater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com) has started a process
thanks to partners [Efabless](http://www.efabless.com) and
[Google](http://www.google.com) to revolutionize how we make
semiconductors.  The process here is an attempt to provide a simple way to make a
semiconductors using open-source tools.  In other words, we are
democratizing hardware design
through open-source chip design tools and methodology.

[GlobalFoundries](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/08/GlobalFoundries-joins-Googles-open-source-silicon-initiative.html) has
also partnered with [Google](http://www.google.com)
to revolutionize how we make
semiconductors with open-source tools.  

For this process we have created several tools that help with this
process.  We welcome your feedback as well as any comments to help
with this process.
